## About me
I am working as an Financial App Antifraud Analyst for two years now and I fell the need to delve into Developing sphere to impove myself and obtain better understanding how our App is made. 

Also I am very crafty person, as a hobby I weave baskets and make vector illustrations via Adobe Illustrator. I think new JS skill will afford me to promote my creative side by creating my own porfolio and maybe selling tool.

I’m interested in App and Web Development because it provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.
